# Algorithm for Real-Time Stock Market Prediction

## Description

This project aims to create an algorithm that predicts stock market trends in real-time based on historical data and news sentiment. By leveraging advanced techniques in time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling, the system seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of stock market predictions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Time Series Analysis:** Techniques for analyzing time series data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Processing and understanding human language from news articles and financial reports.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Assessing the sentiment of news articles and social media to gauge market sentiment.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building models to forecast future stock prices and market trends.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess historical stock data and news articles to ensure they are clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Historical stock prices, financial news articles, social media sentiment.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, handling missing data.

### 2. Time Series Analysis

Develop models to analyze historical stock price data and identify patterns.

- **Techniques Used:** ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM.
- **Metrics Used:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### 3. Sentiment Analysis

Analyze the sentiment of news articles and social media posts to gauge market sentiment.

- **Techniques Used:** Text classification, sentiment scoring.
- **Libraries/Tools:** NLTK, spaCy, Transformers (BERT).

### 4. Predictive Modeling

Implement predictive models to forecast future stock prices and market trends.

- **Techniques Used:** Regression, classification, ensemble methods.
- **Algorithms Used:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM.

### 5. Real-Time Processing

Integrate real-time data processing capabilities to adapt to changing conditions and make immediate predictions.

- **Tools Used:** Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, real-time databases.

### 6. Evaluation and Validation

Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics and validate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

- **Metrics Used:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

### 7. Deployment

Deploy the prediction algorithm for real-time use in a trading environment.

- **Tools Used:** Flask, Docker, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
